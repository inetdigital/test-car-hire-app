```
npm test
```

## Notes

- Very rudimental example of implmentation of basic setup of the UI - capped at 2 hours - Not worked with Vue in the past 3 years
- Example to show approach of componentization, reuseable components, central theme settings, use of Jest tests
- User process used in this example is arbitary as in a real world example it would go through a system design process and UX design process to inform the user journey etc

### Future Enhancements and To-Do

- Code commments
- Implement API integration: Replace mock data fetching with actual API calls to fetch data, save bookings etc
- Enhance Error Handling: Introduce error handling for API calls, user interactions, and routing
- Optimize Performance
- introduce state managment
- Expand Test Coverage
- Accessibility considerations
- UI/UX Enhancements

- Add loader screen, component or overlay between actions
- Style form items, add other required fields, provide form validation and handler
